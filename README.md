## AWS Iot Global Device Provisioning

Customers are building globally distributed IoT solutions with AWS IoT. A device that should connect to AWS IoT must be provisioned in the related AWS region. However when devices are shipped globally at the time of shipping it is not known to what AWS IoT region the device will be connected when it starts operation. With the sample implementation we do show customers how they can build a solution to provision IoT devices globally.
